# ü§ñ Mastodon RSS Bot
Mastodon RSS Bot is a customizable bot that reads news from an RSS feed and posts them automatically to a Mastodon account. Perfect for bloggers and content creators, the bot keeps your followers up-to-date with the latest news in your field.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
To set up the bot, modify the `MastodonAPI.json` file in the `Configuration` folder and fill it with the following information:

<pre><code>
{
  "MastodonInstance": "mastodon.social", //Change this to your mastodon instance if necessary 
  "MastodonAppID": "PUT_HERE_YOUR_APP_ID",
  "MastodonAccessToken": "PUT_HERE_YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
}
</code></pre>

Replace `PUT_HERE_YOUR_APP_ID` with your Mastodon app ID, and `PUT_HERE_YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your Mastodon access token. If necessary, change `mastodon.social` to your Mastodon instance.

You can also modify the `RssList.json` file in the `Configuration` folder to track the RSS feeds you want. Simply add the URL of the RSS feed to the list, and the bot will automatically start posting new articles to your Mastodon account.

# üöÄ Usage
To use the bot, simply run the MastodonRssBot executable. The bot will periodically check for new articles in the RSS feeds and post them to your Mastodon account.

1. Download the latest release from the releases page.
2. Extract the zip file to a directory of your choice.
3. Navigate to the `MastodonRssPoster` directory.
4. Open the `Configuration` directory and modify the `MastodonAPI.json` and `RssList.json` files to your liking.
5. Run the `MastodonRssPoster` executable. The bot will now start running.
